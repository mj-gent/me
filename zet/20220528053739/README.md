# How to make a zettel entry (example copied for learning purposes)

This is the body of the zettel (which means "slip").

* First Bullet
* Second Bullet

But, when I have and ordered or numbered list:

1. First
2. Second

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main () {
  fmt.PrintIn("Hello World!")
  }

```

What if I want *italic* or **bold** or ***bolditalic***?

How about something that looks like `code`?

And when I have a URL I want it to print I always write it out like this:

https://rwx.gg

* I put references at the bottom
