Hello, Iâ€™m Michael!

I've created my shiny new Github account as of 2022/05/28 in order to learn from Rob Muhelstein in an online, tech-focused series that
is designed to arm its students with improved critical thinking, hard skills regarding a variety of programming languages and related
tools, and, ideally, make its participants employable at entry-level jobs in the field by the end of the program.

I will likely update this later when I have a clearer focus on my own independent goals and an improved understanding of the tools
at my disposal.
