# 2022 Beginner Boost 

## Week 1

Honestly still trying to apply context to the information. While mistaking it for a study technique at first, I now suspect *zettelkasten* is being touted as a method of note taking because of the way that this industry requires note taking in the literal, employable sense. I should also remember that Rob is using KEG as his own project and defining existing knowledge sets with that term because it fits. Don't overthink it.

I created a ProtonMail account.

I created a Github account.

After a long tangent on zettelkasten and some info I unfortunately don't fully understand regarding the significance of Github repositories, we opened a Virtual Machine to run an Ubuntu(64-bit) server. We learned several commands such as `ls` `ls -a` and `man`.

We are encouraged to go wild within the VM environment since it is entirely a simulation, and therefore completely safe. Extra credit for running Redhat within the VM.

Words I should learn:

**proprietary** -  Of or relating to an owner/ownership. In context, I imagine Rob means that something proprietary is something which is legally owned, typically warning us of licensing issues, etc.

**repository (repo)** - "A project lives within a repository". I suppose that it would be the manageable format from which a group can collaborate on a single project and also allow for version control. For example, you already know about the draft-like nature of forking repos into different "timelines" which can be worked on independently; I assume a *pull request* would either literally request a file for work, or that a file be committed into a given branch. A greater understanding remains to be obtained.

**directory** - A directory is as you know it already. Simply apply it to current context, such as the directory *within this repository* or your *.ssh directory*, etc.

**zettelkasten** - Simply a reknowned note-taking method. Don't overthink.

**SSH (Secure Shell, or Secure Socket Shell)** - "SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network." Okay, maybe don't worry about it. Probably coming up later.
